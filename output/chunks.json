    "text": "A Quick Guide to Burnout \n“Burnout” is a common word, but what does it really mean? How do we deal with it when it happens? \nWhat is “burnout?” \nThe Meriam-Webster Dictionary defines burnout as: “exhaustion of physical or emotional strength or \nmotivation usually as a result of prolonged stress or frustration.” \n•\nThis can be further fueled by a workload that is either unfulfilling or unstainable for a long period.\n•\nIt can lead to both physical and mental symptoms, like headaches or a lack of motivation.\nWhat can I do? \n•\nIdentifying meaning in your work - It can be easy to see homework, classes and assignments as\n“meaningless” and “busy work,” but this mindset often fuels burnout. Consider what reasons you have\nfor continuing your academic career, and why you find your major interesting or fulfilling personally.\n•\nFinding balance in daily activities - Academics is not the only important part of life. Spending time with\nfriends, exercising, relaxation and engaging in hobbies can boost our mood and help counteract feelings\nof burnout.\n•\nTake frequent, fulfilling and intentional breaks - Studying for long periods at a time usually leads to\nretaining less information and feeling mentally exhausted. Taking breaks to stretch, breathe, go outside\nor do something fun can give us renewed energy and motivation.\n•\nTake care of your basic needs - While it may feel imperative to pull an all-nighter to finish studying,\nstudies show that sleep can further cement the things we’ve learned throughout the day to memory, as\nwell as improve focus, concentration and motivation. Try not to trade sleep and food for study time.\nWhat campus resources can help me? \n•\nOn Demand Workshops - We have daily workshops on a variety of mental health topics that you can\nstop in any time you want to. Find more information about workshops online.\n"
